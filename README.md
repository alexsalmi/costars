# Costars

A web game challenging players to connect two random actors by the movies they've been in and the costars they've worked with, with new pairs becoming available every day! Also includes two additional game modes, one to connect a custom pair of actors, and the other to connect actors and movies for as long as possible.

## Background

The idea for this project came from my fiance and I brainstorming ideas for new daily puzzle games in the vein of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or [HoopGrids](https://www.hoopgrids.com/). We are both very interested in film, so we wanted to come up with something in that category, similar to [Movie Grid](https://moviegrid.io/) or [Framed](https://framed.wtf/). Eventually Erin came up with a game inspired by [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon), where players must connect two new actors every day. After a few months of work, her idea eventually became Costars! The game has been operational and providing new pairings every day since January 1st 2025, please feel free to go to [costarsgame.com](https://costarsgame.com) and give it a try for yourself!
